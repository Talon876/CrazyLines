CrazyLines
==========
This is the Java version of PixelArt (https://github.com/Talon876/Pixel-Art)
It draws lines everywhere and looks cool, that's about it.

Compiling
---------

cd to the directory where the build.xml file is and run:

	ant compile //will compile everything to /build
	ant jar //will compile everything and put an executable jar in /dist
	ant run //compiles everything, makes the jar, runs the jar

The Source
----------

Most of the interesting stuff happens in the crazylines package.
Anything else is explained in the comments, or you can ask me.
